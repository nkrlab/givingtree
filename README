===============================================================================
Introduction
===============================================================================
This is an example project that illustrates how to use the Nexon Funapi.
It consists of a client part and a server part. You need to build both of them
to test.


===============================================================================
How to compile
===============================================================================
Server is in C++ and can be built using the standard `configure && make'

$ ./boot.sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../configure
$ make


Client is shipped ready in Python. So you do not have to build.


===============================================================================
How to run
===============================================================================
First run the server. After building a server, you can see a file named
`giving_tree-launcher'. This is a shell script which pre-loads required
libraries including Funapi. Simply run the script.

$ cd build; ./giving_tree-launcher


Next, run the client.

$ cd client; ./giving_tree_client-launcher


Once connected with the server, you need to login to test the client.
Details are explained in a tutorial which is available at the Funapi website.


Enjoy the game!
